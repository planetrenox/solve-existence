# I Solved Existence

**Existential crisis:** Why is there everything instead of nothing, and why isn't there nothing instead of everything

Any and all answers will break existence but one.


They say the answer is hidden within the question, a concept that becomes particularly relevant when we confront the enigma of existence. Our current scientific endeavors—spanning physics, medicine, and quantum mechanics—appear to be at a standstill, offering no concrete solutions to this profound crisis. It's as if these disciplines, in their pursuit of reductionism, have led us into a dead end. Identifying the smallest unit or unraveling the mysteries of space-time seems to loop us back to square one, leaving us to question if there's any merit in these pursuits.

Imagine, for a moment, granting someone the authority over truth itself. Could they, with such power, decipher the enigma of existence? This thought experiment underscores the limitations of our scientific understanding. It's a stark reminder that, despite our advancements, fundamental questions remain unanswered. We are encouraged to let go of all preconceived notions and to embrace the simplicity of questioning as a means to uncover fundamental truths.

Consider the dilemma of a 2D character endowed with consciousness, struggling to comprehend the concept of a third dimension. Explaining depth to a being that perceives the world in only two dimensions illustrates the limitations of our own understanding when faced with the concept of existence itself. Just as the 2D character cannot grasp the idea of "right" as it pertains to a third dimension, we too find ourselves at a loss to explain the nature of existence using our current dimensional perspectives.

This leads us to a pivotal realization: the existential questions that haunt us—why is there everything instead of nothing, and why isn't there nothing instead of everything—may indeed have an answer within the confines of a dimension where the concepts of everything and nothing coexist. These inquiries hint at a reality that defies our conventional logic, much like explaining a 3D world to a 2D character.

This speculative dimension, beyond the realms of space and time as we know them, posits a reality where contradictions are not just possible but are essential to the fabric of existence. Here, the binary of 0 and 1 coexists, offering a glimpse into a universe that defies our binary logic. This new understanding resolves the existential crisis, as it eliminates the need to question the possibility of our existence. By acknowledging a reality where every condition—nothing and everything—is possible, our existence is affirmed as an undeniable truth.

This realization effectively redefines the scope of scientific inquiry, providing an answer that supersedes all current scientific limitations by stating that every condition is possible. It's an assertion that there is no longer a need to wonder how our existence is possible; this insight provides a definitive answer that every scenario—nothing and everything—is feasible, thus establishing our existence as an incontrovertible fact.

This solve transcends traditional science, offering a comprehensive explanation for existence that leaves no room for doubt. Far from being a humble acknowledgment of our limitations, it is a bold declaration of understanding, firmly placing the essence of existence within our grasp.
