# I Solved Existence Simply

**Existential crisis:** Why is there everything and not nothing? But it would make no sense if there was nothing without something! But it would make no sense if there was something without everything!

Any and all answers will break existence but one.

Simply, the lack of existence is not more natural than existence, and the existence of everything is not more natural than the existence of nothing. Therefore there exists another dimension which allows everything and nothing to simply exist at once. there is no way anything makes sense otherwise. if nothing or everything dont both exist at once, existence is arbitrary. this dimension makes absolutely no sense to us because we cant comprehend everything and nothing existing at once, it is simply like trying to tell a 2D character there is a 3D world. The 4D world is beyond space-time. There can be both 0 and 1!!!

With this I longer have an existential crisis. Because nothing and something both exist!!!!
