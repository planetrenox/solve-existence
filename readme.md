Existential crisis: Why is there anything instead of nothing, and why isn't there nothing instead of everything?

First understand why these questions are important before reading.

Any and all answers will break existence but one. I will be solving existence in this writing.

They say the answer is hidden in the question. So how is it that we simply can’t solve existence? Current attempts currently don’t come close
No; science, physics, medicine, quantum mechanics—appear to be stuck in an endless loop, offering no solutions to this crisis. These disciplines, lead us down a path of reductionism — do you think that if you identified
the smallest unit, or better understood space-time, you’ll get anywhere? It would loop us back to square one— you’ll be right back where you started.

Now what if I could grant you authority over truth, could you solve existence? This thought experiment shows the failure of our science. It's a stark reminder that, despite our advancements, fundamental questions remain unanswered. We are encouraged to let go of all preconceived notions and to embrace the simplicity of questioning as a means to uncover fundamental truths.

Consider the hypothetical of a 2D game character endowed with consciousness, struggling to comprehend the concept of a third dimension. Explaining depth to a being that perceives the world in only two dimensions illustrates the limitations of our own understanding when faced with the concept of existence itself. Just as the 2D character cannot grasp the idea of "right" as it pertains to a third dimension, we too find ourselves at a loss to explain the nature of existence using our current dimensional perspectives.

This leads us to a pivotal realization: the existential questions—why is there anything instead of nothing, and why isn't there nothing instead of everything—may indeed have an answer within the confines of a dimension where the concepts of everything and nothing can both exist. A reality that defies our conventional logic, much like explaining a 3D world to a 2D character.

With this dimension, the binary of 0 and 1 breakdown, offering a glimpse into a state that defies our binary logic; establishing our existence as an incontrovertible fact.

This solve transcends traditional science, offering an explanation for existence that leaves no room for doubt. Far from being a humble acknowledgment of our limitations, it is a bold declaration of understanding, firmly placing the essence of existence within our grasp.

So reality has more to it than the universe that we can currently see? Well, yes, accepting the explanation would imply there is more to the universe; accepting that both everything and nothing can exist at once, would in fact imply that ALL can be true at ALL times (notice how if ALL is true it would need to collapse into and expand out of itself, because ALL cannot be static but instead recursive since ALL requires ALL? Being multi-dimentional, giving an answer why our universe is NOT frozen in time but in flow.

Furthermore, I've never seen a better argument that manages to produce God as a side effect.
