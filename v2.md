There exists only 1 meaningful dimension &nbsp; (0 &nbsp; 1)

No beginning but ever in motion.

Why? Time is the intersection  &nbsp; ✕

✕ will represent time but at only the first intersection    
in reality it looks like ＊    
but only a point like expanding circle can represent every intersection also known as flow of time     
but that is not its truest form either since the more we intersect the more room there is for intersection     
this leaves room for even more intersection     
the cost is hyper-exponential and greatest at center of mass

Time by itself is meaningless. It is simply the intersection   

Fundamentally gives a vague answer why circles or points are so common

black holes suggest a collapse of time/matter is possible, or simply the collapse of our point like circle. perhaps the intense gravity is its retraction of all that ever expanded. regaining what was lost. Cant revert time without a black hole in the middle.


**the following english is really really weird:**     
- the phrase "point in time"   
  - Any other languages that specify point in time with a point? I speak another language and we don't do this.
- time (multiplication) sharing the word with time (clock)
  - In my other language we don't do this either.
This suggests the english language is founded on strong fundamentals and maybe why prefered.



Everything true is true and everything false is true.
There exists 'thing' which is combination.
There can be 'everything' or however you want to call it. a combination of all 0s may suggest blackhole but only ever problematic if center point in time.
