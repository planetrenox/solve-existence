There exists only 1 meaningful dimension &nbsp; (0 &nbsp; 1)

No beginning but ever in motion.

Why? Time is the intersection  &nbsp; ✕

✕ will represent time but at only the first intersection    
in reality it looks like ＊    
but only a point like expanding circle can represent every intersection also known as flow of time     

Time by itself is meaningless. It is simply the intersection    
Fundamentally gives a vague answer why circles or points are so common

Everything true is true and everything false is true.
There exists 'thing' which is combination.
There can be 'everything' or however you want to call it.
