statement: there must be a very good reason why we cant comprehend the universe, its matrix, what its source should look like, whether it is finite, or why its here. I believe the answer lies in the fact that we try to answer all these questions with what we could 'see'. there must be a major flaw there, i bet the reason why we cant comprehend it is because we are stuck in 3 dimensions and the matrix is actually infinite dimensions. once you think with the capacity of infinite dimensions you realize there is no more concept of space (space is an illusion of our 3 dimensional view). You realize that once you are dealing with infinite dimensions, there is no concept of shape and this is really hard to imagine because there is no example to compare to. Everytime you try to visualize it or see it you have already failed.

statement: If the brain is counsious, then everything is conscious. The only reason brain is special is because it found a way to record counsiousness of senses and replay. Yes this means counsiousness is rudimentary. We think it's special but we actually mean our memory + senses are special, was already counsious. Also all of this means we never die or lose counsiousness, we just lose our senses.
